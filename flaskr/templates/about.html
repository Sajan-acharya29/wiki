        <p><strong>Sajan Acharya</strong><br>Hello, my name is Sajan Acharya and I am currently a sophomore majoring in computer science at Howard University. I have had a passion for computer science since high school and have been fortunate enough to continue pursuing it in college. Currently, I am serving as an undergraduate research assistant in an AI ML research project and will also be interning with Salesforce's network team this summer. Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy travelling to new places, playing soccer, and watching anime. In fact, all of the destinations on this website are on my travel wishlist!</p>
